# CPPMats
CPPMats is a flexible and lightweight matrix and vector library for C++ that offers similar functionality to matrices offered by MATLAB. Similar to MATLAB, there is only one type (Mat) that behaves as a scalar, vector (row and column), and matrix. Essential functions like cross product, dot product, determinants and others are included with more to come.
